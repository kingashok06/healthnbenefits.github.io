                                ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF

                                MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS OF USE THAT PROVIDES FOR A

                                AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION
                                WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

                                Choice of Law; Disputes. These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the State of
                                Illinois, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree to submit
                                to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts
                                sitting in Illinois for any and all disputes, claims and actions arising from or in
                                connection with the Services and/or these Terms of Use. Health N Benefits operates
                                the Services from its offices in Illinois, and we make no representation that the
                                Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. You agree not to
                                export from anywhere any part of the Services provided to you, or any direct product
                                thereof, except in compliance with, and with all licenses and approvals required under,
                                applicable export laws, rules and regulations. These Terms of Use may only be amended by
                                a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties to these Terms
                                of Use. If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable,
                                then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced with a valid, enforceable
                                provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the
                                remainder of these Terms of Use will continue in effect. The section titles in these
                                Terms of Use are solely used for the convenience of the parties and have no legal or
                                contractual significance.
                            </p>

                                Health N Benefits may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time with
                                or without notice to you. You may not assign these Terms of Use, or assign, transfer or
                                sublicense your rights, if any, in the Services. Health N Benefits's failure to
                                act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to act with
                                respect to subsequent or similar breaches. Except as expressly stated herein, these
                                Terms of Use, and all expressly incorporated terms and agreements, constitute the entire
                                agreement between you and Health N Benefits with respect to the Services and
                                supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications of any kind between you and
                                Health N Benefits with respect to the Services. The following sections of these
                                Terms of Use shall survive any termination of these Terms of Use: 4, 6-9, 11-13, and
                                15-23. Consent to Communications. By using the Services, you consent to receive certain
                                electronic communications from Health N Benefits as further described in the
                                Privacy Policy. Please read the Privacy Policy to learn more. You agree that any
                                notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that Health N Benefits
                                sends to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including
                                that those communications be in writing. The Services may provide web forms, links, or
                                contact information, including phone numbers, that can connect you with Health N Benefits
                                or third parties, such as Third-Party Providers. Communications through these
                                methods may be routed through a third-party service (Communications Service). Calls may
                                be recorded or monitored for quality assurance and customer service purposes. You will
                                be notified at the beginning of a call if it may be recorded or monitored. You consent
                                to such recording and monitoring by Health N Benefits or the Communications
                                Service.
                            </p>

                                Health N Benefits also uses the Communications Service to track phone calls and
                                text messages so that Health N Benefits can access certain details about the
                                contact. As part of this process, Health N Benefits and the Communications Service
                                will receive in real-time, and store, data about your call or text message, including
                                the date and time of the call or text message, your phone number, and the content of the
                                text message. You consent to these practices by Health N Benefits and the
                                Communications Service.

                                Submitting this form constitutes my signature and agreement that the Health N Benefits's

                                website, and I understand and agree that this consent applies even if my number is
                                listed on a state or federal do-not-call list. In no event shall either party be liable
                                for special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including, but not limited
                                to, loss of use, or loss of profits.

                                Prospect agrees he/she is solely responsible for any and all third-party fees a prospect
                                may incur when being contacted by Health N Benefits its business divisions,
                                affiliates, partners, clients, vendors and list managers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Prospect irrevocably agrees that if a dispute, claim or controversy of any kind arises
                                between the prospect and Health N Benefits or any or all of its
                                advertisers/marketing partners, the prospect agrees to resolve the dispute, claim or
                                controversy by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration association
                                in the state of Illinois (USA) or another location mutually acceptable to the parties.
                                This arbitration provision limits a prospect's ability to litigate claims in court and a
                                prospect's right to a jury trial. A prospect also waives his/her right to participate as
                                a class representative or member of any class of claimants for any and all claims
                                subject to arbitration. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this
                                agreement as well as opt-out/cancelling of service of any and all kinds by the prospect.
                                In event of arbitration the non-prevailing party will pay for any and all reasonable
                                legal expenses (lawyer fees only) of the prevailing party.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If any of the terms are held unenforceable, the reminder of the terms shall remain in
                                effect. Please DO NOT digitally sign this agreement if you do not agree with our terms
                                and conditions.

                                Health N Benefits reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time, with
                                or without cause. Termination notice may be provided via email or any other public means
                                and will be effective immediately. By agreeing and digitally signing this Agreement, the
                                Prospect warrants that Prospect is at least 18 years of age, and that there is no legal
                                reason that Prospect cannot enter into a binding contract.
